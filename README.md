# Simple-practice-form
A super simple form that you can input your name in and have it show in the display box, or you can display the title of the form in the display box. Both will display a photo.
Created October 16, 2021 as practice for my intro to programming test at NBCC Saint John with instructor Cathy Burchill. I was just playing around with colors, there was no design concept for this.
